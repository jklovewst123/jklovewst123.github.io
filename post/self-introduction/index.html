              <p>From my PhD study since 2011, I have participated a project (named Study of Key Technology of Broadband Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits) from the National High Technology Research and Development Program and two projects (named Study of the Optimization on Noise and Flatness of Silicon-based Broadband Multi-Stage Low Noise Amplifiers and Study of the Optimization on Accuracy and Flatness of Silicon-Based Broadband Digital Active Phase Shifter) supported by Natural Science Foundation of China. I have read a lot of RF front-end integration technology literatures, accumulated a lot of experience in high-speed design and layout optimization, after two taping out and testing work, and completed the auxiliary analog circuit design of RF circuit (bandgap, current source and operational amplifier), and completed the design of RF circuit modules such as low noise amplifiers and variable gain amplifiers. Wideband (6-18 GHz) on-chip low noise amplifier circuits have been successfully designed, which have accumulated valuable design foundations for my later designs.<br>
In March 2016 (advanced graduation), I joined the research institute of AVIC, and worked on the design of SerDes circuit module development and analog IC. As a major R&amp;D personnel, I participated in one Air Force project, one in the Army Aviation Project, and one in the Military Science and Technology Commission project. I have completed 10Gbps high-speed comparator design, SerDes modeling research, high-gain operational amplifier, bandgap reference, and 8-bit DA analog part, power amplifier circuit, analog linear feedback correction circuit research and development work, an adaptation and transformation from RF circuit to analog IC design.<br>
From 2018 to the present, I worked at Xi'an University of Technology and participated in the team of Professor Yu Ningmei. My current research direction is mainly RF research and high-precision analog IC design.</p>
